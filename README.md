# HeartRate-Correlation-Group-Project

This project analyzes sleep quality using biometric data collected from wearable devices. Using heart rate (HR), inter-beat interval (IBI), and blood volume pulse (BVP), we built regression and classification models to explore how these signals relate to sleep disorders and overall sleep health.

## What We Did
Aggregated physiological metrics from 20 participants in the DREAMT dataset
Encoded medical history and sleep disorder data
Built linear regression models to predict HR, IBI, and BVP behavior
Visualized residuals, prediction accuracy, and feature importance

## Key Findings
IBI metrics had the strongest correlation with sleep quality
BVP variability and HR_std also revealed predictive patterns
Sleep disorder presence showed a modest but measurable effect

## Tools & Tech
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib
DREAMT dataset (Duke University Sleep Disorder Lab)
